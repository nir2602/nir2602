## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science at Dalhousie University, currently I work as a Undergraduate Reasercher at Programmable and Intelligent Networking Lab, under the supervision of Dr. Israat Haque!

Previously I worked as a Junior Software Engineer for Nova Scotia's Department of Cybersecurity & Digital Solutions.

I like Computer Networks and their security, as well backend development!
